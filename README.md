Customer Churn Prediction Project
Overview:
Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses aiming to retain their customer base and maximize profitability. In this project, we develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn, enabling proactive measures to be taken to prevent customers from leaving our service.

Objectives:
Predictive Model Development: We will build a robust machine learning model using historical customer data.

Feature Engineering: Exploring and engineering features that provide valuable insights into customer behavior and potential churn.

Model Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation of model performance to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Actionable Insights: Utilizing the model's predictions to identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to reduce churn rates.

Dataset:
We will be working with a dataset containing historical customer information, including demographics, transaction history, customer interactions, and churn status.

Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the patterns and relationships within the data to inform feature selection and engineering.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

Model Building: Training and evaluating machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting for churn prediction.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

Deployment: Integrating the trained model into a production environment for real-time predictions or batch predictions.

Expected Outcomes:
A predictive model capable of identifying potential customer churn with high accuracy.
Actionable insights and recommendations for customer retention strategies based on the model's predictions.
Impact:
Business Growth: By reducing customer churn rates, we aim to improve customer satisfaction and increase revenue.

Customer Experience: Proactive measures can lead to a better customer experience and loyalty.

Operational Efficiency: Efficiently allocating resources towards retaining customers who are likely to churn.

Tools and Technologies:
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, GitHub.
